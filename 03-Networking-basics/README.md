# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals & Hands-On Practice

This folder documents my **networking knowledge, hands-on labs, commands, and practical exercises** from completing a full Networking Fundamentals course.

It includes:
- Key Notes and concepts I learned  
- Key networking commands  
- Certificate link 

This section demonstrates my understanding of the network layer that underpins **cloud computing, DevOps, and infrastructure engineering**.

## 📘 What I Learned

### 🔹 Core Networking Concepts
- What a network is & how data travels  
- LAN, WAN, WLAN, MAN  
- Switches, routers, modems, access points  
- IPv4 vs IPv6 fundamentals  
- Subnetting basics  
- Public vs private IP  
- DNS and DHCP  
- Ports and protocols  
- OSI Model (L1–L7)  
- TCP/IP Model  
- NAT, PAT, routing basics  
- Firewalls and security basics  

### 🔹 Cloud-Relevant Networking
- CIDR notation  
- VPC concepts (foundation for AWS)  
- Internet gateways  
- Route tables  
- Subnets  
- Network isolation  
- Security groups vs firewalls

## 🧰 Essential Commands I Practiced

### **Linux / Windows Networking Commands**
- `ping` – test connectivity  
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` – check network configuration  
- `ip addr` – detailed IP info  
- `tracert` / `traceroute` – path to a destination  
- `nslookup` – DNS lookup  
- `netstat` – active connections & ports  
- `arp -a` – view ARP table  
- `route print` / `ip route` – routing table  

### **Packet Flow Understanding**
- How packets move from device → switch → router → internet  
- How DNS resolves names  
- How DHCP assigns IP addresses

## 🚀 Why Networking Matters

Networking is the backbone of:
- Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- DevOps pipelines  
- Infrastructure engineering  
- Security  
- Server management  

A strong networking foundation makes advanced concepts like **VPCs, subnets, routing, load balancing, and firewalls** much easier.
